ROBOT JOYSTICK CONTROL
========================================

This is a small project that I made to control a robot (Mine was Pioneer 3-AT) from a web interface, using a cool joystick (Thanks to virtual-joystick.js) and I even added voice control with apiAi.

To run this project on your host, you need to have ROS and ROSbridge running.

Have fun.
